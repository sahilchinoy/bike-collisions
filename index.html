        <h3>Sources and methodology</h3>
        <p>Data is from the California Highway Patrol's <a href="http://iswitrs.chp.ca.gov/Reports/jsp/userLogin.jsp">Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System</a>, which aggregates data collected at the collision scene. Their records include a field that indicates whether a bicycle was involved in each collision. In the Berkeley Police Department's jurisdiction, a total of 2,227 incidents since January 2001 have involved a bicycle.</p>
        
        <p>The data also indicates the severity of the accident, on a scale from 0 to 4. Fatal accidents are assigned a 1, severe injuries are assigned a 2, and so forth. In calculating the danger index, incidents with a severity of 1 added 10 points to the index, incidents with a 2 added 5 points, incidents with a 3 added 3 points, incidents with a 4 added 2 points, and incidents with a 0 added 1 point. Each intersection was normalized against the maximum total of 45 points at Dwight Way and Milvia Street.</p>
